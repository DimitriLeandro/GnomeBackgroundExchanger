# GnomeBackgroundExchanger
I recently installed Fedora 26 OS and realized that there were not many options for background management, so I decided to create a java application to automatically change background images in a given time.

Here you can define which images you want and how often they should change.

Update: I've made updates to run this app in Mate interface too. It was developed in Fedora 26, but tested in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu Mate 18.04 LTS.

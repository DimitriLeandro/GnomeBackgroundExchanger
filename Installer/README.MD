# INSTALATION INSTRUCTIONS

First, you must copy the folder "Gnome_Background_Exchanger" to your "opt" folder. If you can't paste it there, probably you had permission denied, so, open Nautilus as Root to do that.

After pasting it there, make shure to give "create and delete files" and "read and write" access to "Gnome_Background_Exchanger" folder to all kind of users. This will be necessary afterwords.

Then, create a desktop launcher to the aplication. Copy "Gnome Background Exchanger.desktop" to "usr/share/applications". Again, if you can't do it, just open Nautilus as Root.

The application won't run if you don't have "default jre" installed in your system. You can install it by "sudo apt-get install default-jre" in Ubuntu based systems, or "sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk" in Fedora systems.

You must have "gedit" installed in your system too. You can get that by "sudo apt-get install gedit" or "sudo dnf install gedit".

And that is it!

Obs: When you run the application, select "Selecionar Imagens" button. Here is an exemple of what should be there:
